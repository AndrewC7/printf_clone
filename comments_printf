/* stdio.h printf always has a string as the first arg, regardless of whether
 or not it's just format tags or a larger printable string containing format
 tags. */

/* so if const char * const format is that string, looking at the example
 outputs from their main, we don't measure the length in chars until the end,
 after all formatting */

Line 42:
/* iterating though to print it char by char, we test for the % fmt tag
 indicator: */

Line 44:
/* iterate though fmt tag members of each struct in array 'type' */

Line 46:
/* if the next char in format matches one of the type members of the structs
   in array 'type' */

Line 48:
/* execute function pointed to by f_ptr on the next arg in va_list,
 and add the return value to count */

Line 49:
/* iterate past the tag once for '%', again for matched char */

Line 52:
/* code currently successfully handles non-matching tag after %.
 See "Unknown:[%r]" in main.c */

/* turns out escape chars are part of shell, do not need to build them into
   printf. defualt putchar handles them. */
