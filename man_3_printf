- stripped down version of the stdio.h function printf().
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf [FORMAT] [ARG1] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The first group project for 1st trimester Holberton students learning C, emulates some of the basic functionality of the stock printf()
.SH OPTIONS
.B _printf
_printf() produces output according to a format and writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
Upon successful return, _printf() returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
The format string is a character string and is composed of zero or more directives:
ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream
conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.
Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags: 
.PP
.B d, i:
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The default precision is 1.
.PP
.B c: 
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.PP 
.B s: 
*The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0')
